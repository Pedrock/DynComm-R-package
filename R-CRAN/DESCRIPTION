Description: This package is used for evolving network analysis regarding 
  community detection. Implements several algorithms that calculate communities 
  for graphs whose nodes and edges change over time.
  Edges, which can have new nodes, can be added or deleted. Changes in the 
  communities are calculated without recalculating communities for the entire 
  graph.
